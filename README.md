# -X-ray-Image-Denoising-with-Filters-and-Metric-Evaluation-for-Digtal-Image-Processing
This project demonstrates image denoising on a grayscale X-ray image affected by Salt-and-Pepper noise using various filtering techniques. It also evaluates the performance of each method using PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure).

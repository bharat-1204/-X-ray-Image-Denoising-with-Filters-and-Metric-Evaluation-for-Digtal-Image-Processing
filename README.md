# -X-ray-Image-Denoising-with-Filters-and-Metric-Evaluation-for-Digtal-Image-Processing
This project demonstrates image denoising on a grayscale X-ray image affected by Salt-and-Pepper noise using various filtering techniques. It also evaluates the performance of each method using PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure).
ðŸ“‚ Project Overview
â€¢Load and normalize a grayscale X-ray image.
â€¢Introduce salt-and-pepper noise artificially.
â€¢Apply four denoising techniques:
â€¢Median Filtering
â€¢Gaussian Blur
â€¢Bilateral Filtering
â€¢Non-Local Means Denoising
â€¢Compare the effectiveness of each method using PSNR and SSIM metrics.
â€¢Display the results using matplotlib.

ðŸ“¸ Sample Output
â€¢Visual comparison between the original, noisy, and restored images.
â€¢Bar plots for PSNR and SSIM across all denoising methods.

ðŸ“¦ Dependencies
â€¢Make sure the following libraries are installed:
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy matplotlib scikit-image
ðŸ§ª How to Run
â€¢Place your grayscale X-ray image in the same directory as the script.
â€¢Rename it to x-ray2.jpg (or modify the filename in the script).
â€¢Run the script:
python denoise_xray.py

ðŸ›  Code Highlights
ðŸ”§ Add Salt-and-Pepper Noise
def add_salt_pepper_noise(img, amount=0.09):
Adds synthetic noise to test the performance of filters under extreme conditions.

ðŸ§¹ Denoising Filters
restored_median = cv2.medianBlur(noisy_image, 3)
restored_gaussian = cv2.GaussianBlur(noisy_image, (5,5), 0)
restored_bilateral = cv2.bilateralFilter(noisy_image, d=9, sigmaColor=75, sigmaSpace=75)
restored_nlmeans = cv2.fastNlMeansDenoising(noisy_image, None, h=10, templateWindowSize=7, searchWindowSize=21)

ðŸ“Š Image Quality Evaluation
psnr_vals = [psnr(image, r) for r in restored_images]
ssim_vals = [ssim(image, r) for r in restored_images]
Calculates how close the denoised image is to the original using PSNR and SSIM.

ðŸ“ˆ Results Example
â€¢Median Filter: Great for salt-and-pepper removal.
â€¢Gaussian Blur: Slightly blurs edges.
â€¢Bilateral Filter: Retains edges while smoothing noise.
â€¢Non-Local Means: High quality, but computationally expensive.
